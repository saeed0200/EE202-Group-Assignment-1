## Project Overview  
This project is a **Modular Command-Line Calculator** offering four main modes:

1. **Standard Mode:** Performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc.).  
2. **Programmer Mode:** Includes base conversions and bitwise operations.  
3. **Scientific Mode:** Offers trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.  
4. **Converter Mode:** Converts between units of length, weight, and temperature.  

The goal is create a user-friendly Modular Command-Line Calculator.

##  How to Run  
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.  
3. Run the main file: main.py

-Challenges Faced

During development we encountered several challenges:

1-Managing module imports and returning control from each mode to the main menu.

2-Ensuring consistent error handling without crashing the program.

3-Designing clear menus and user prompts for smooth navigation.

-Extra Features
1-History of previous calculations.

2-Colored terminal output .

3-Extended unit conversions.
